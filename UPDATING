####Major changes for iohyve v0.7.7:

- The `utc` property has been added to indicate that the `-u` flag should be passed
	to bhyve so that bhyve's system clock is in UTC. The `create` command now sets
	this property to `YES`, so the default behavior for a guest is for its system
	clock to be in UTC, which is typically what is most appropriate for *nix OSes.

####There are two major changes in iohyve v0.7.5

- The `fetch` command has been renamed to `fetchiso` to comply
	with the naming scheme of `fetchfw`, `cpiso`, `cpfw`, etc...

- The `autogrub` property is no longer supported. You can now run what
	is in your `autogrub` property in a `grub.cfg` if you set
	the `os` property to `os=custom`. More information can be found on the README
	https://github.com/pr1ntf/iohyve#use-your-own-custom-grubcfg-and-devicemap-files
